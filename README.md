# TK1 gene expression analysis

This repository contains the bioinformatics analysis implemented in  the manuscript, [Membrane expression of thymidine kinase 1 and potential clinical relevance in lung, breast, and colorectal malignancies](https://cancerci.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12935-018-0633-9). Specifically, this code analyzes RNA-Seq data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) to assess differential expression of the TK1 gene in breast cancer patients.
